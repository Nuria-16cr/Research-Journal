left,"Chen, Faye ","Student Artist, Codewords","From the Codewords exhibition I really enjoyed Faye Chen’s work, Chen pulls us into an alternate galaxy the incredible colour and sound design triggered on click pulls the viewer into her alternate world. I really enjoyed the mesmerising effect of the words wrapping around each other in an endless circle to me it gives the illusion of an eye. The 3d text block are constantly being pulled inwards as new ones appear giving you just enough time to read the information ‘the looming eye at the bottom of the page’ is chanted like a mantra across the text blocks like an eerie warning. The work is also mouse interactive; the viewer can zoom into the work by dragging the mouse to the right or zoom out by placing it to the left.",https://i.postimg.cc/J4CQyFpH/fayechen.png,Faye Chen's final project for 'Codewords',https://faye12.github.io/CodeWord/majorProject/MajorProject_Final/,"PersonalProject, Interaction"
left,"Moore, Jonathan Fletcher ","Artist, USA","The Artificial Killing Machine is an interactive kinetic art installation by Jonathan Fletcher Moore an American artist. The installation aims to illustrate the overlooked killings by U.S military drone strikes by turning otherwise statistics into a vivid physical representation of casualties that this drone strikes truly amount to.  The system monitors public database for U.S drone strikes and upon detecting a new one the installation triggers a a set of toy cap guns, they are fired once for each fatality reported by the attack. The installation then prints out the location, number of deaths and a brief description of the attack, representing and humanising the victims. As the machine prints out the multiple attacks and the receipt paper keeps getting longer and longer, we are faced with a visual representation of the magnitude of this issue. Society has been desensitised to the implications of modern warfare; Moor’s Artificial Killing Machine confronts the viewers with the harsh reality of war and conflict by representing individuals who have merely been reduced to a statistic and acknowledging their human qualities and weight of their death.",https://i.postimg.cc/zfDy4C0f/killing-Machine.jpg,"Cap guns from the Artificial Killing Machine instalation, 2015",https://www.polygonfuture.com/artificial-killing-machine,"Violence, Political "
left,"Munari, Bruno  / Chindōgu","Designer / Artist / Inventor, Italy","Chindōgu is a term to describe technically functioning gadgets that are impractical and inconvenient. The term was coined by Kenji Kawakami a Japanese inventor who published the book “101 Unuseless Japanese Inventions” in 1995. Some of these useless inventions include, umbrella shoe savers, automatic chew counter, portable stoplight, cat tongue soother, fish face cover, butter stick and many more. Bruno Munari was an Italian artist, designer and inventor who sought to make design more playful and accessible, he played into the idea of Chindōgu to develop his ‘useless machines’. He started developing his machines in 1930s, they were small structures design to move gently and not perform any kind of task. Munari created sketches for potential ‘useless machines’, this humorous and ridiculous machines spark so much imagination, not everything needs to be hyper functional, I believe we are taught to fixate on design that it is intuitive, accessible and will essentially ‘make our life easier’, we forget the endless possibilities of the designing without the limitations of functionality, and the beauty that there is in making a machine or an interactive object which its intent was never to optimise a performance.",https://i.postimg.cc/bYt7cKGZ/munari2.jpg,"Image from the book 'Munari's Machines, 1942",https://www.moma.org/artists/4163-bruno-munari,"Chindōgu, Inventive"

His artistic endeavours encompass a wide array of mediums, including interactive websites, performances, quilted sculptures, neon installations, and educational projects. His work has a spiritual element he creates rituals and symbols that bridge the digital and physical realms. One of his websites ‘behind the solar glow’ resembles an interactive piano, with the long curtains as the keys and his signature circles weighing them down, the user can move them around and each time it will trigger a new sound. He uses these same circles as a cursor in his own website; the circle creates a trail and bounces back into the cursor.",https://i.postimg.cc/fyDjPttj/Plessas.png,"Plessas' website Behind the Solar Glow, 2024",https://behindthesolarglow.com/,"Spiritual, Musical"
left,"Roosegaarde, Daan ","Artist, Netherlands","Dutch designer Daan Roosegaarde developed the installation DUNE as a ""techno-poetry"" that merges the human experience with interactive technology creating an immersive space. DUNE has been exhibited internationally in museums and public spaces; the artwork is made from thousands of LED fibres that respond to the sound and movement of passing visitors. This installation is reminiscent of the film avatar when glowing lights open and close as they pass by and sea creatures such as corals that close when they sense movement nearby. The installation was presented in urban spaces, Roosegaarde challenges the boundaries of natural and built environments; in doing so he creates a harmony between the two that is only the human presence which brings DUNE to life.",https://i.postimg.cc/FH7bwQRq/dune2.webp,"Image from DUNE exhibition, 2009",https://www.studioroosegaarde.net/project/dune,"Interactive, Techno-poetry"

Inside the furniture there are LED lights that light up based on each person’s contribution to the conversation, the more LEDs the more contribution. It is an effective tool for facilitating collaborative conversation and improving social dynamics through self-awareness.",https://i.postimg.cc/xdLmSjSs/balancetable.png,"Digital prototype of the Balance Table, 2016",https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/balance-table/overview/,"Balance, Collaboration"

The interactive story takes us though the journey of Vietnamese refugees fleeing though the Vietnam sea. The hand drawn illustrations, motion graphics and sound build a 20-minute reading experience where the reader becomes fully immersed in the story. Given the dramatic nature of the story, the combination of elements that make up the viewing experience successfully achieve a greater emotional response from the viewer, which is what makes this artwork so successful and commemorative of the fall of Saigon.",https://i.postimg.cc/nLLPrW3f/boat.jpg,Landing page of The Boat's website,https://www.sbs.com.au/theboat/,"Imersive, Storytelling"

Based off the idea that smart watches can track so much now a days, and the challenge that baby’s and young children pose at the hospital, Teddy the guardian was born to soothe children while still collecting the necessary data. The bear can be used at a medical institution or at home to monitor the temperature of a sick child and keep constant track of their vital signs, the teddy has a glowing heart which lights up and beats at the same rhythm as the child’s, if the child’s temperature changes to a dangerous level the teddys heart will glow a different color giving the parent immediate warning.",https://i.postimg.cc/HkycQWjp/teddyjpg.png,Teddy the Guardian's final design,https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/12/teddy-the-guardian-the-protective-plushie-gets-400k-in-seed-investment/,"Medical, Infants"

The glove includes sensors made from conductive thread that pick up on the hand motions that the user makes which can then be translated into words, letter and numbers. The electrical signals are wirelessly received by a smart phone that voices them into spoken word at an approximate rate of one word per second.",https://i.postimg.cc/g0GznGZt/glove.png,"Initial prototype of the Wearable-tech glove, 2020",https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/glove-translates-sign-language-to-speech,"Translate, Communication"
